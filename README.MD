The goal of this repository is to implement deep neural network architectures exclusively from research papers. This helps me to understand the ideas of those papers. If you denote any mistakes in some implementations, feel free to fix it.

Current list of implemented DNN architectures :

- Resnet50 (paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf)
- U-Net (paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)
